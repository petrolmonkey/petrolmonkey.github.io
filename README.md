# Introduction
**enable Pages in repository settings**

Hi, I'm Charlie - a curious builder transitioning from Mechanical Engineering in Aerospace to Data Science. After completing a Data Science certificate at UC Irvine, I gained hands-on skills in Python, SQL, data processing, and predictive modeling.

These projects showcase how my manufacturing mindset—from designing casting, layup and assembly tools-drives data-driven insights. Explore below to see real-world applications.

Looking forward to connecting!

~~Keep repositories public for accessibility, then set up GitHub Pages for a professional portfolio site. Create a repository named  yourusername.github.io , add an  index.html  or customize the README.md with project links, images, and descriptions, and enable Pages in repository settings under the “main” branch. Your site goes live at  https://yourusername.github.io , ideal for linking in applications.~~
