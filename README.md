# Introduction

Hi, I'm Charlie - a curious builder transitioning from Mechanical Engineering in Aerospace to Data Science. After completing a Data Science certificate at UC Irvine, I gained hands-on skills in Python, SQL, data processing, and predictive modeling.

These projects showcase how my manufacturing mindset—from designing casting, layup and assembly tools-drives data-driven insights. Explore below to see real-world applications.

Looking forward to connecting!
-Charlie
